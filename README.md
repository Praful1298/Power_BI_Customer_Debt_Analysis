## 🏦 American Bank Report: Customer & Financial Insights Dashboard
An interactive Power BI dashboard designed to uncover banking trends based on customer demographics, loan behavior, and regional distributions. The report highlights how factors such as marital status, education, gender, and state influence total balances and customer engagement.

## 📌 Purpose

📊 Power BI Desktop – Used to design and develop the data visualizations.

🔄 Power Query – Enabled robust data cleaning and transformation for accurate reporting.

🧮 DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) – Used for key performance metrics like average balance, customer count, and filtering interactions.

📁 Data Model – Multiple tables such as customers, balances, and demographics were joined for cross-filtered analytics.

💾 File Format – Built and exported from Power BI (.pbix); previewed as PNG snapshots for demonstration.
